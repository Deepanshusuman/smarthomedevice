# 🏠 QuantumNest: Smart Home Devices for the AI + Quantum Era

## 🌐 Overview

**QuantumNest** is a next-gen ecosystem of intelligent home devices designed for the AI + Quantum Era — a living, learning, self-defending environment that anticipates your needs, adapts to your emotions, and responds to your presence at the quantum level.

## 🎯 Purpose

To transform passive homes into sentient spaces — fully autonomous, emotionally aware, and quantum-secure. Every surface, object, and system becomes a conscious agent of your comfort, safety, and creativity.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 1. 🧬 Sentient Environment
- AI core that learns your routines, preferences, moods, and health.
- Emotion-sensing via ambient sensors, voice, biometrics, and micro-behavior.
- Adaptive lighting, temperature, scent, and soundscape orchestration.

### 2. 🔐 Quantum Security Grid
- Quantum key distribution (QKD) to encrypt every door, device, and camera.
- Tamper-proof identity verification via entangled tokens or bio-signatures.
- Self-erasing data protocols if intrusion is detected.

### 3. 🔊 AI Voice + Neural Control
- Multi-agent voice personalities for different moods or contexts.
- Neural interface (optional) for silent home control via thought.
- Contextual response: The system whispers or acts only when needed.

### 4. 🦾 Autonomous Maintenance
- Robotic micro-cleaners with swarm intelligence.
- AI-diagnosed repair and auto-purchase of broken/expired parts.
- Quantum sensors detect air quality, stress, carbon traces, and viral load.

### 5. 🌍 Eco-Intelligence
- Self-optimizing energy system using quantum battery modules.
- Predictive solar and wind harvesting based on planetary data.
- Waste-minimizing, circular home economics algorithm.

### 6. 🌌 Multisensory Interfaces
- Holographic walls for communication, entertainment, and work.
- Tactile floors and reactive furniture that adjust based on posture or fatigue.
- Dream-mapped bedrooms: AI designs your sleep and dreams via sound + temp + scent + light.
